<h2>Voice & Tone</h2>
<p>We should use appropriate voice and tone to allow us to better connect and reach with our users. Best Case endorses a conversational style that should feel like talking between colleagues or friends â€“ personal, relatable, clear, helpful, and engaging. Conversational style allows us to resonate with our users in a clear and concise fashion in which they will easily understand.</p>
<h3>Voice</h3>
<p>Our voice expresses our principles and personailty. It offers a sense of trust and connection to our users and helps empower them to meet their business goals. Our voice should be the same across all our products.</p>
<h3>Tone</h3>
<p>Tone conveys your attitude toward what you are writing about and who you are writing to. When we create content for the platform such as error messaging or tooltips, be sure to answer two questions: What are you trying to say (the important information that the user needs to know) and how should you say it (the experience you want to create for the user)? Understanding both will help create effective, on-target content.</p>
