      Constistency is critical to good usibility. It doesn't mean everything has to be a complete replication. Using the same elements in various ways escapes the mundane and creates uniformity ensuring a stable user experience. Consistency also helps user confidence in knowing they've executed correctly and after repeated use, seeing the same elements creates familiarity that the users begin to trust.
