  <h3>Best practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use font sizing, and weight to create hierarchy and focus.</li>
    <li>  Identify proper page hierarchy and carry it through</li>
    <li>  Evaluate all the visual elements (size, padding, spacing) before going down a rabbit hole.</li>
    <li>  Accommodate for visual deficiencies such as low vision and color blindness.</li>
    <li>  Use proper contrast to achieve the legibility of the design.</li>
    <li>  Avoid eye strain (such as incompatible color combinations).</li>
    <li>  Use color with purpose. Color alone should not drive a reaction/decision.</li>
